Osmocom Iuh experimentation code
(C) 2015 by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>

This code is a playground for implementing something along the lines of
the an Iuh interface of a HNB-GW.  The intent is to later integrate this
with OsmoNITB + OsmoSGSN, in order to have 3G capable 'network in the
box'.

h1. Building

As external library dependencies, you will need
* libosmocore from git://git.osmocom.org/libosmocore
* libasn1c from git://git.osmocom.org/libasn1c
* libsctp-dev (this is the package name in Debian)
* libosmo-netif from git://git.osmocom.org/libosmo-netif (sysmocom/sctp branch)
* libosmo-sccp from git://git.osmocom.org/libosmo-sccp (sysmocom/iu branch)

To bootstrap the build, in the root directory, run:

    autoreconf --install

After that, run the usual

    ./configure [options]
    make
    [sudo] make install

h1. Using

Note: osmo-iuh is in active development (December 2015, January 2016) so below
statements may outdate rapidly.

there's not much to use yet.  But if you run the 'hnbgw' executable,
it will open a listening SCTP socket and wait for incoming Iuh
connections.  It will accept any HNB-REGISTER-REQUEST, so the homeNodeB
should start to establish RUA and RANAP (which we haven't implemented
yet).

h1. Regenerating C code from ASN.1 source

In order to re-generate the C source code from the ASN.1 source,
you will need a modified asn1c which has the following features:
* APER support (the patch from Eurecom, or its forward-ported version
  from the aper branch of git://git.osmocom.org/asn1c)
* support for prefixing the generated types (aper-prefix branch of
  git://git.osmocom.org/asn1c)
