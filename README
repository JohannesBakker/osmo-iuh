Osmocom Iuh expermientation code
(C) 2015 by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>

This code is a playground for implementing something along the lines of
the an Iuh interface of a HNB-GW.  The intent is to later integrate this
with OsmoNITB + OsmoSGSN, in order to have 3G capable 'network in the
box'.

h1. Building

Just go to the 'src/' directory and type make.  As external library
dependencies, you will need
* libosmocore from git://git.osmocom.org/libosmocore
* libasn1c from git://git.osmocom.org/libasn1c

h1. Using

there's not much to use yet.  But if you run the 'hnbgw' executable,
it will open a listening SCTP socket and wait for incoming Iuh
connections.  It will accept any HNB-REGITER-REQUEST, so the homeNodeB
should start to establish RUA and RANAP (which we haven't implemented
yet).

h1. Regenerating C code from ASN.1 source

In order to re-generate the C source code from the ASN.1 source,
you will need a modified asn1c which has the following features:
* APER support (the patch from Eurecom, or its forward-ported version
  from the aper branch of git://git.osmocom.org/asn1c)
* support for prefixing the generated types (aper-prefix branch of
  git://git.osmocom.org/asn1c)
